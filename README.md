# Check-Me-In
Automated airline check-in service, with built-in scheduling. 

This is my experimental branch, in which I tried unsuccessfully to add in account creation and passwords. I ran into numerous problems, first with getting two models to talk to each other, and later with trying to get Delete to work WITHOUT deleting the user's entire account. 

I spent many, many hours on this branch. So, rather than throw it away, I'd like to keep it in the event that I become experienced enough to fix it someday.
